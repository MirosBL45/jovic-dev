It is like a little game show and the rules are: you can click on each week to open its section and watch short clips, then you collect stickers for that week. After watching all 4 weeks, you get cool stickers as a gift. If you watch on a mobile phone, you can save the stickers in Viber and send them to your friends. || In my previous company, 4bees, I have been working on this project from scratch after getting design in Figma. I mostly worked for the desktop version, but I also helped a colleague with the mobile version.",
